Supcut is a simple and unobtrusive Python continuous unit testing tool.

During TDD a certain amount of unit test is usually not satisfied. A developer
is usually not interested in reading the output of every unsuccessful tests.

Instead, it is handy to receive a notification once a previously failing test starts to succeed, and viceversa.

Supcut continuously monitor the Python source and test files in your project directory and runs Nose when such files are modified.

By comparing the outputs of sequential runs it detects changes in the test outcomes and shows a small popup using Desktop Notification (OSD).

The reported events are:

- A previously failing test is now successful
- A previously successful test failed
- A new test has been added
- An existing test has been removed

Supcut tries to stay out of the way of your development process: No changes are
required to your sources or test files to run it.
